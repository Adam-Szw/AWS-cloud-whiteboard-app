To develop the app:
- install Eclipse IDE
- open 2 instances of Eclipse IDE
- create 2 Eclipse workspaces - one for the server and another for client
- in each Eclipse workspace create an empty Java project
- clone git repository somewhere
- copy folder whiteboard-server/whiteboard_server/src from repository into your server workspace project src folder and replace it
- do the same for the client workspace using whiteboard-client/whiteboard/src from the repository
- in both projects now right click on src in the project explorer (window on the left in Eclipse) and click 'refresh'
- for the server -> right click on Server.java and click 'run as' -> app
- for the client use App.java in application package
